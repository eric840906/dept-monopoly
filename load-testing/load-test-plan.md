# Load Testing Strategy - Dept-Monopoly

## Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive load testing strategy to validate the Dept-Monopoly game can reliably support 120 concurrent players across mobile and desktop platforms.

## Current System Analysis

### Architecture Components
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with Socket.IO
- **Rate Limiting**: 200 requests/10min per IP, 10 connections/IP/minute
- **Socket Configuration**: 90s ping timeout, 25s ping interval
- **Connection Recovery**: 5-minute disconnection recovery window
- **Max Capacity**: 120 players, 6 teams

### Critical Performance Points
1. **Socket.IO Connection Handshake**
2. **Player Join/Team Assignment**
3. **Real-time Game State Synchronization**
4. **Mini-game Submission Processing**
5. **Dice Roll Processing**
6. **Score Updates and Broadcasting**

## Performance Targets

### Primary Metrics
| Metric | Good | Acceptable | Critical |
|--------|------|------------|----------|
| Connection Time | <1s | <2s | >3s |
| Socket Event Response | <100ms | <300ms | >500ms |
| Game State Sync | <200ms | <500ms | >1s |
| Mini-game Load | <500ms | <1s | >2s |
| Memory Usage | <512MB | <1GB | >1.5GB |
| CPU Usage | <70% | <85% | >95% |

### Socket.IO Specific Metrics
- **Connection Success Rate**: >99%
- **Message Delivery Rate**: >99.9%
- **Reconnection Success**: >95%
- **Transport Upgrade Success**: >90%

## Load Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Connection Load (20 concurrent)
- Test basic connection handling
- Validate rate limiting
- Measure baseline performance

### Phase 2: Team Formation (60 concurrent)
- Simulate realistic team joining patterns
- Test team distribution algorithms
- Validate concurrent team operations

### Phase 3: Gameplay Simulation (100 concurrent)
- Full game flow simulation
- Mini-game concurrent processing
- Real-time state synchronization

### Phase 4: Peak Load (120 concurrent)
- Maximum capacity testing
- Stress connection recovery
- Mobile/desktop mixed load

### Phase 5: Sustained Load (120 for 30 minutes)
- Memory leak detection
- Connection stability
- Performance degradation monitoring

## Testing Environment Requirements

### Infrastructure
- **Test Server**: Minimum 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM
- **Load Generators**: Multiple machines to avoid client bottlenecks
- **Network**: Low latency connection to target server
- **Monitoring**: APM tools for real-time metrics

### Test Data
- Pre-generated player names and departments
- Realistic mobile/desktop user agent strings
- Various network latency simulations
- Different geographical IP ranges

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Socket.IO Connection Storms**: Rapid simultaneous connections
2. **Team Join Race Conditions**: Multiple players joining same team
3. **Mini-game Timeout Handling**: Concurrent timeout processing
4. **Memory Leaks**: Long-running connections with event listeners
5. **Rate Limiting False Positives**: Legitimate traffic blocked

### Mitigation Strategies
- Gradual connection ramp-up
- Connection jitter to avoid thundering herd
- Comprehensive cleanup testing
- Rate limit threshold validation
- Mobile-specific testing scenarios
