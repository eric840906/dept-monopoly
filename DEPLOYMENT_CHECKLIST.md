## IT Team Deployment

### Server Preparation
- [ ] Linux server available (Ubuntu/Alpine compatible)
- [ ] Docker and docker-compose installed
- [ ] Port 3000 available and accessible
- [ ] SSL certificates ready (if HTTPS required)
- [ ] Reverse proxy configured (nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Firewall rules updated for mobile access

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Copy `.env.docker` to server
- [ ] Generate secure HOST_TOKEN: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- [ ] Set production ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- [ ] Verify all required variables set
- [ ] Test configuration: `docker-compose config`

### Deployment Execution
- [ ] Load Docker image on server
- [ ] Start services: `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Verify container running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl localhost:3000/network-info`
- [ ] Verify mobile access from test device
- [ ] Check logs for errors: `docker-compose logs`

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Main application accessible via domain
- [ ] Mobile interface works on company network
- [ ] WebSocket connections established
- [ ] No security warnings in browser console
- [ ] Resource usage within expected limits
- [ ] Logs showing normal operation

## Production Monitoring

### Health Checks
- [ ] Application endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/network-info`
- [ ] Mobile endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/mobile`
- [ ] WebSocket connectivity test
- [ ] Container resource usage monitoring

### Log Monitoring
- [ ] Application logs configured
- [ ] Error alerting set up
- [ ] Log rotation configured
- [ ] Performance metrics tracked

### Backup & Maintenance
- [ ] Container image backup stored
- [ ] Environment configuration backed up
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested
- [ ] Update procedure documented

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Steps
```bash
# Stop current version
docker-compose down

# Load previous version
docker tag dept-monopoly:v0.9.0 dept-monopoly:latest

# Restart with previous version
docker-compose up -d
```

### Quick Diagnostics
```bash
# Container status
docker-compose ps

# Recent logs
docker-compose logs --tail=50 dept-monopoly

# Resource usage
docker stats dept-monopoly-app

# Network connectivity
curl -f http://localhost:3000/network-info
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Diagnosis | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| CORS errors | Mobile can't connect | Check ALLOWED_ORIGINS |
| 404 on static files | Assets not found | Verify image build |
| High memory usage | Resource leak | Check logs, restart if needed |
| WebSocket failures | Connection drops | Check firewall, proxy config |
