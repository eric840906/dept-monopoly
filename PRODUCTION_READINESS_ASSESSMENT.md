## 4. Resource Usage and Capacity Planning

### Current Resource Profile
```
Resource Utilization (120 players):
├── Memory: 39MB RSS / 10MB Heap
├── CPU: Low utilization with room for growth
├── Network: 501 msg/sec throughput
├── Connections: 458 concurrent (max tested)
└── Storage: Minimal (in-memory state)
```

### Capacity Planning

#### Single Server Capacity
- **Conservative Estimate**: 200 concurrent players
- **Optimistic Estimate**: 500+ concurrent players
- **Current Target**: 120 players (60% margin)

#### Resource Requirements (Production)
```
Minimum Production Specs:

└── OS: Linux (Alpine/Ubuntu recommended)
```

#### Scaling Strategy
1. **Vertical Scaling**: Current single-server approach sufficient
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Load balancer + sticky sessions if needed
3. **Database**: File-based adequate; Redis for multi-server deployment
4. **CDN**: Static assets via CDN for global distribution
